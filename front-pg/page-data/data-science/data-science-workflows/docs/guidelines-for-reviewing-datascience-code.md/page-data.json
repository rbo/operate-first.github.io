They provide developers with a well defined approach to sharing knowledge, ensuring exposure to new ideas and technologies, enforcing quality assurance of code and standards for the engineering process across both the code base and the team itself. As members of the AI CoE in the office of the CTO, we believe that having a well defined approach for how to do the same thing with data science and machine learning code is critical. Although, code is code, and we approach data science work as a subset of software engineering, there are some data science specific challenges associated with the code review process that should be addressed. Below are the 10 principles we use in our group to review data science work.</p>\n<ol class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li><strong>Understand the Context</strong> : Make sure you read the pull request description and any linked issues so you know the data scientist’s goal. This will help you provide an appropriate level of feedback and focus on the meaningful changes. </li>\n<li><strong>Rich Diffs</strong> : Use tools like <a href=\"https://www.reviewnb.com/\">NBreview</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime\">nbdime</a> when possible to review notebooks. These kinds of tools help you zero in on the notebook changes that actually matter. </li>\n<li><strong>Is it Coherent?</strong> : Notebooks generally contain a mix of code, markdown and plots. Do these elements reference each other correctly? Is the evaluation metric being used here suitable for the ML algorithm ? If you don’t understand something or are curious about why a certain approach was implemented, ask and get clarification.</li>\n<li><strong>Check the Math!</strong> : Machine Learning code can run successfully while still being wrong and not achieving the appropriate task. Read the notebook thoroughly and try to look for any mathematical errors in the code with reference to the PR’s stated goal. </li>\n<li><strong>Does it solve the right problem?</strong> : Make sure the goals of the PR or notebook are met, the key takeaways are highlighted and the data scientist’s interpretation of any statistical and/ or experimental results are included.</li>\n<li><strong>Introduce new libraries or technologies</strong> : When working on a data science project, there might be times when you are aware of a library or new technology that can address the problem in a more efficient way. In such scenarios, you should suggest this approach in the code review.</li>\n<li><strong>Is it reproducible?</strong> : Are all of the dependencies used to run the code appropriately tracked using a pipfile or requirements.txt ? If you are unsure about any outputs or results, clone the pull request to your environment and run it yourself. It should run from top to bottom without error and generate the same outputs as are presented in the PR.</li>\n<li><strong>Understand the visualizations</strong> : When reviewing a PR that includes visualizations, make sure to check for the proper labeling of axes and ticks. All the values mentioned should be clear and have an explanation for each graph.</li>\n<li><strong>Hardcoded Credentials and Paths</strong> : Sometimes developers use hardcoded credentials, secrets and even data directories for quick tests and easy access when needed and forget to remove them before publishing them to github. When reviewing a Data Science code, make sure to check for any credentials/secrets as this practice poses a significant security risk that can allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and ensure that the data management is handled properly and there are no hardcoded directories in the code.</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluate the Output</strong> : Everything looks right, but our validation results are way worse than expected. Sometimes the simplest things can go wrong like over-fitting, poorly tuned hyper-parameters or maybe an inappropriate distance metrics being used? Make sure to double-check all the smallest detail when reviewing a ML code.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>References</strong> :</p>\n<p>There are various guidelines for standard Pull Request reviews, here are a few examples, but our principles take these best practices into consideration and targets Data Scientists working on AI/ML code using Jupyter Notebooks.</p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/developing/code-reviews\">https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/developing/code-reviews</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/code-review\">https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/code-review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://taingmeng.medium.com/what-you-should-look-out-for-when-you-review-pull-request-3f2d95a50ba9\">https://taingmeng.medium.com/what-you-should-look-out-for-when-you-review-pull-request-3f2d95a50ba9</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.codacy.com/how-to-code-review-in-a-pull-request/\">https://blog.codacy.com/how-to-code-review-in-a-pull-request/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/15-topics-to-consider-as-you-review-code-in-data-science-10eff0182e71\">https://towardsdatascience.com/15-topics-to-consider-as-you-review-code-in-data-science-10eff0182e71</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"srcLink":"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/data-science-workflows/blob/master/docs/guidelines-for-reviewing-datascience-code.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"","description":null,"extraClasses":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"04b177c9-ff1f-5092-9fa3-e4d257052ebc"}},"staticQueryHashes":["117426894","3000541721","3606484676","533861647"]}
