These KPIs can not only help us evaluate any AI-based enhancements we make to the CI processes, but also pinpoint what specific areas need the most improvement and therefore should be devoted resources to. The notebooks contained in this directory define, calculate, and save several KPIs that we believe are relevant to various personas (developer, manager, etc.) involved in the CI process.</p>\n<p>These notebooks are also available for viewing and running on the public <a href=\"https://jupyterhub-opf-jupyterhub.apps.zero.massopen.cloud/hub/login\">JupyterHub instance</a> provided via the Operate First initiative.</p>\n<p>When addressing a KPI request, please make sure to follow the <a href=\"metric_template.ipynb\">Metric-template.ipynb</a> that defines a template for calculating metrics using <a href=\"number_of_flakes.ipynb\">number-of-flakes.ipynb</a> as an example.</p>\n<p>The following section describes what each of these KPIs represent, and links to the notebooks that calculate these.</p>\n<h2 id=\"list-of-available-metrics\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#list-of-available-metrics\" aria-label=\"list of available metrics permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>List of Available Metrics</h2>\n<ol class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of tests blocked</strong> : What is the total number of blocked tests on testgrid i.e. where the value in the cell is “8”.</p>\n<p><a href=\"blocked_timed_out.ipynb\">Blocked-timed-out.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Blocked tests Percentage :</strong> What is the percentage of blocked tests on testgrid i.e. where the value in the cell is “8”.</p>\n<p><a href=\"blocked_timed_out.ipynb\">Blocked-timed-out.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of tests timed out</strong> : What is the total number of timed out tests on testgrid i.e. where the value in the cell is “9”.</p>\n<p><a href=\"blocked_timed_out.ipynb\">Blocked-timed-out.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Timed out tests Percentage</strong> :  What is the percentage of timed out tests on testgrid i.e. where the value in the cell is “9”.</p>\n<p><a href=\"blocked_timed_out.ipynb\">Blocked-timed-out.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of builds passed</strong> : What is the total number of builds that were passing i.e. had the “Overall” cell labeled as passing on testgrid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"build_pass_failure.ipynb\">Build-pass-failure.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Percentage of builds passed</strong> :  What is the percentage of builds that were passing i.e. had the “Overall” cell labeled as passing on testgrid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"build_pass_failure.ipynb\">Build-pass-failure.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of builds failed</strong> :  What is the total number of builds that were failing i.e. had the “Overall” cell labeled as failing on testgrid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"build_pass_failure.ipynb\">Build-pass-failure.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Percentage of builds failed</strong> :  What is the percentage of builds that were failing i.e. had the “Overall” cell labeled as failing on testgrid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"build_pass_failure.ipynb\">Build-pass-failure.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change in success and failure</strong> : What is the change in success and failure builds for all tests relative to the total number of builds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"build_pass_failure.ipynb\">Build-pass-failure.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Correlated test failure sets per test</strong> : What is the number of tests highly correlated with a given test i.e. with a correlation coefficient of 0.9 or above.</p>\n<p><a href=\"correlated_failures.ipynb\">Correlated-failures.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Average size of correlation set</strong> : What is the average size of correlated test sets as calculated in the above metric.</p>\n<p><a href=\"correlated_failures.ipynb\">Correlated-failures.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flaky tests</strong> : What is the number of flaky tests i.e. where the value of the cell is “13”, aggregated over each platform, grid, or tab for each day/week/month.</p>\n<p><a href=\"number_of_flakes.ipynb\">Number-of-flakes.ipynb</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flake Severity</strong> : What is the percentage of flakes by test overall.
